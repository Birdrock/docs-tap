# Using Vulnerability Scanning in air-gapped (offline) environments for Supply Chain Security Tools - Scan

This topic tells you how to use Grype in air-gapped (offline) environments for Supply Chain Security Tools (SCST) - Scan.

> **Note** For air-gapped (offline) environments, VMware recommends using Aqua Security's Trivy scanner with Scan 2.0.  This greatly simplifies the installation and maintenance experiences over Anchore Grype and Scan 1.0.  See [here](overview.hbs.md#overview-of-supply-chain-security-tools---scan) for more information on Scan 1.0 versus Scan 2.0.
