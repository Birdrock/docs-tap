# Use Vulnerability Scanning in offline and air-gapped environments

> **Note** For air-gapped (offline) environments, VMware recommends using Aqua Security's Trivy scanner with Scan 2.0.  This greatly simplifies the installation and maintenance experiences over Anchore Grype and Scan 1.0. For more information on Scan 1.0 versus
Scan 2.0, see [Overview of Supply Chain Security Tools - Scan](/scst-scan/overview.hbs.md).
