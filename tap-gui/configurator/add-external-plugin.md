# Add an external plug-in

<!-- It's not in the ToC right now because it's not finished -->

Use Tanzu Developer Portal Configurator to add functions (plug-ins) to Tanzu Developer Portal,
turning it into a customized portal.

There are several scenarios in which Configurator can help you to integrate a compatible plug-in.
You can:

- Add a [validated community Backstage plug-in](#validated-community)
- Add a [non-validated community or custom Backstage plug-in](#non-validated-custom)

As of Tanzu Application Platform v1.7, Configurator can integrate an existing plug-in, but it cannot
create a new Backstage plug-in.

VMware Tanzu, as an organization, can assist you with creating your own plug-in or with
modifying an existing plug-in to your specification. For more information, see
[Tanzu Labs](https://tanzu.vmware.com/labs).

For more information about how to create a Backstage plug-in, see the
[Backstage documentation](https://backstage.io/docs/plugins/create-a-plugin/).
