# Overview of Tanzu Developer Portal plug-ins

This topic gives you an overview of the different plug-in types that Tanzu Developer Portal
supports. Some plug-ins are already integrated with Tanzu Developer Portal. Other plug-ins require
you to use Configurator to integrate them.

Community plug-ins are not developed by Backstage or VMware. These plug-ins are not in the
`@backstage` namespace.

## <a id='valid-plug-ins'></a> Validated plug-ins

Validated plug-ins are Backstage plug-ins or community plug-ins that VMware has validated for use
with Tanzu Developer Portal. You don't need to create custom wrappers to integrate these plug-ins
with Tanzu Developer Portal.

## <a id='ext-plug-ins'></a> External plug-ins

External plug-ins (also referred to as custom plug-ins) are plug-ins that are not in
Tanzu Developer Portal Configurator.

These plug-ins are typically published to npmjs.org or a similar npm registry alternative. If you
want to integrate an external plug-in that is not validated for use with Tanzu Developer Portal, you
must write a custom wrapper for it.
