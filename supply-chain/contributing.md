Guide for teams contributing docs to the Supply Chain component section.

## Top section

* Beneath the title, start with an `In this section` paragraph such as:
  ```
  The section introduces...
  The topics in this section explain...
  ```
* Try to use a product name where practical

This helps with SEO.
  
## Naming

The base product is called `Tanzu Supply Chain`. It's especially important not to 
shorten this to `Supply Chain` as it becomes too easily confused with the resource kind.

Resource Kinds should be referred to by their CamelCase name:
* SupplyChain
* Component
* WorkloadRun


## Headings and verbs
Each H1 heading in a topic and TOC heading should, where practical start with a verb.
For example,
   `Supply Chain Authoring` should be `Author a supply chain`
   `How to create Workload` should be `Create a workload`
