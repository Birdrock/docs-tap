# Installing with the 'authoring' profile (Recommended)

{{> 'partials/supply-chain/beta-banner' }} 

The recommended way of installing TAP with Supply Chain support is to use the "authoring" profile, this will install all the
required packages for you.

To do this update your `tap-values.yaml` to contain: 

```yaml
profile: authoring
```
