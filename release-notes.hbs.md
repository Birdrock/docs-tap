### <a id='1-7-0-new-features'></a> v1.7.0 New features by component and area

This release includes the following changes, listed by component and area.

#### <a id='1-7-0-COMPONENT-NAME'></a> v1.7.0 Features: COMPONENT-NAME

- Feature description.

#### <a id='1-7-0-api-autoreg'></a> v1.7.0 Features: API Auto Registration

- Introduces API curation feature in alpha that is intended for only testing.
- New `CuratedAPIDescriptor` custom resource allows aggregating multiple APIs of type OpenAPI in a single curated API.
- Integrate with Spring Cloud Gateway for Kubernetes to automatically generate
  `SpringCloudGatewayMapping`s and `SpringCloudGatewayRouteConfig`s.
- API Auto Registration controller exposes API endpoints to view all curated APIs or filter for specific APIs to
  add as API portal's source urls.

#### <a id='1-7-0-app-acc'></a> v1.7.0 Features: Application Accelerator

- Includes built-in integration of application bootstrap provenance through an accelerator into
  Artifact Metadata Repository (AMR).
  This enables application architects to get advanced insight into how accelerators are used,
  such as, the most commonly and rarely used accelerators.

#### <a id='1-7-0-app-live-view'></a> v1.7.0 Features: Application Live View

- Developers can override the settings for the Kubernetes default liveness, readiness, and startup probes
  for Spring Boot apps in Tanzu Application.
  For more information, see
  [Configure liveness, readiness, and startup probes for Spring Boot applications](./spring-boot-conventions/config-probes.hbs.md).

#### <a id='1-7-0-app-sso'></a> v1.7.0 Features: Application Single Sign-On

- Supports Kubernetes 1.28.
- `ClientRegistration`s instantaneously react to updates of `AuthServer`s.
- `ClusterWorkloadRegistrationClass`s instantaneously react to updates of
  `AuthServer`s
- Insufficiently small token signature keys cause an explicit error condition in
  `AuthServer.status`.
- Customize a `ClientRegistration`'s display name.
- Customize the display names of identity providers for an `AuthServer`, with the
  restriction that this customization applies only to OpenID and SAML.
- Authorization servers log role mappings in the audit log.
- Authorization servers advertise the supported client authentication and grant
  types methods by using the OpenID discovery endpoint.
- End-users see their email address on the consent page.
- `AuthServer.spec.cors.{allowHeaders, exposeHeaders, allowCredentials,
  allowMethods}` provide Service Operators with finer control over an
  authorization server's CORS configuration. As a result, Application Operators
  can use the `client_credentials` grant for single-page apps.
- Authorization servers do not advertise the device auth endpoint by using the
  OpenID discovery endpoint.
- Authorization server UI uses the Clarity design system.
- `ClientRegistration` uses finalizers.
- `ClusterUnsafeTestLogin` reports its issuer URI in its status and as a print
  coloumn.
- Authorization servers support the user-information endpoint.
- `AuthServer.spec.session.expiry` controls the session expiry of authorization
  servers. The default value is `15m`. It must be at least `1m`.

#### <a id='1-7-0-app-config-service'></a> v1.7.0 Features: Application Configuration Service

- The default interval for new `ConfigurationSlice` resources is now 60 seconds.
- When debugging `ConfigurationSlice` resources, you now see status information from `GitRepository`
  resources if any of the errors are related to the `GitRepository` reconciliation.

#### <a id='1-7-0-eso'></a> v1.7.0 Features: External Secrets Operator

- External Secrets Operator has now reached General Availability.
- Adds SYNC, GET, LIST and CREATE commands to the CLI. The GET command lets you get more details
  about your external secrets and secret stores. The CREATE command lets you create cluster
  external secret and cluster secret stores. For more information, see the [Tanzu CLI Command Reference](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-CLI/1.0/tanzu-cli/command-ref.html) documentation.

#### <a id='1-7-0-cli'></a> v1.7.0 Features: Tanzu CLI & plugins

- This release includes Tanzu CLI v1.0.0 and a set of installable plug-in groups that are versioned
  so that the CLI is compatible with every supported version of Tanzu Application Platform.
  See [Install Tanzu CLI](install-tanzu-cli.hbs.md) for more details.

##### <a id='1-7-0-tanzu-cli-insight-plugin'></a> v1.7.0 Features: Tanzu CLI Insight plug-in

- You can access reports from each scan to find out what packages and vulnerabilities were discovered using `tanzu insight report`. For more information, see the [Tanzu CLI Command Reference](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-CLI/1.0/tanzu-cli/command-ref.html) documentation.
- You can rebase vulnerability triage analyses using `tanzu insight triage rebase`. For more information, see [Rebase multiple analyses](cli-plugins/insight/triaging-vulnerabilities.hbs.md#rebase-multiple-analyses) and the [Tanzu CLI Command Reference](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Tanzu-CLI/1.0/tanzu-cli/command-ref.html) documentation.

#### <a id='1-7-0-cli'></a> v1.7.0 Features: Tanzu Developer Portal & plugins

##### <a id='1-7-0-tanzu-cli-insight-plugin'></a> v1.7.0 Features: Supply Chain plug-in

- You can add triage analysis to vulnerabilities from a vulnerability scanner step. For more information, see [Triage Vulnerabilities](tap-gui/plugins/scc-tap-gui.hbs.md#triage-vulnerabilities)

#### <a id='1-7-0-cert-manager'></a> v1.7.0 Features: cert-manager

- `cert-manager.tanzu.vmware.com` is upgraded to `cert-manager@1.12`.
  For more information, see the [upstream release notes](https://cert-manager.io/docs/release-notes/release-notes-1.12/).

#### <a id='1-7-0-cnrs'></a> v1.7.0 Features: Cloud Native Runtimes

- **New configuration option `resource_management`**: Allows configuration of CPU and memory for both [Kubernetes request and limits](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/) for all Knative Serving deployments in the `knative-serving` namespace. For information about how to use this configuration, see [Knative Serving Resource Management](./cloud-native-runtimes/how-to-guides/app-operators/resource_management.hbs.md).

- **New config option `cnrs.contour.default_tls_secret`**: This option has the same meaning as `cnrs.default_tls_secret`.
  `cnrs.default_tls_secret` is deprecated in this release and will be removed in Tanzu Application Platform v1.10.0, which includes Cloud Native Runtimes v2.7.0.
  In the meantime both options are supported and `cnrs.contour.default_tls_secret` takes precedence over `cnrs.default_tls_secret`.

- **New config options `cnrs.contour.[internal|external].namespace`**: These two new options behave the same as `cnrs.ingress.[internal|external].namespace`. Starting with TAP v1.7.0,
  `cnrs.ingress.[internal/external].namespace` is deprecated and will be removed in Tanzu Application Platform v1.10.
  In the meantime, both options are supported, but `cnrs.contour.[internal/external].namespace` will take precedence
  over `cnrs.ingress.[internal/external].namespace`.

- **New Knative Garbage Collection Defaults**: CNRs is reducing the number of revisions kept for each knative service from 20 to 5.
  This improves the knative controller's memory consumption when having several Knative services.
  Knative manages this through the config-gc ConfigMap under `knative-serving` namespace. See the [Knative documentation](https://knative.dev/docs/serving/revisions/revision-admin-config-options/). The following defaults are set for Knative garbage collection:
    - `retain-since-create-time: "48h"`: Any revision created with an age of 2 days is considered for garbage collection.
    - `retain-since-last-active-time: "15h"`: Revision that was last active at least 15 hours ago is considered for garbage collection.
    - `min-non-active-revisions: "2"`: The minimum number of inactive Revisions to retain.
    - `max-non-active-revisions: "5"`: The maximum number of inactive Revisions to retain.

  For more information about updating default values, see [Configure Garbage collection for the Knative revisions](cloud-native-runtimes/how-to-guides/garbage_collection.hbs.md).

- **Knative Serving v1.11**: Knative Serving v1.11 is available in Cloud Native Runtimes. For more information, see the [Knative v1.11 release notes](https://knative.dev/blog/releases/announcing-knative-v1-11-release/).

- **Knative Serving Migrator Job added**: CNR now runs a new job in the knative-serving namespace that is responsible for ensuring that CNR uses the latest Knative Serving resource versions.

#### <a id='1-7-0-contour'></a> v1.7.0 Features: Contour

- **Contour v1.25.2**: Contour v1.25.2 is available in the TAP. For more information, see the [Contour v1.25.2 release notes](https://github.com/projectcontour/contour/releases/tag/v1.25.2) in GitHub.

- **New config option `loadBalancerTLSTermination`**: Allows configuring the Envoy service's port for TLS termination. For more information on how to use this config, see [Configure Contour to support TLS termination at an AWS Network LoadBalancer](./contour/how-to-guides/configuring-contour-with-loadbalancer-tls-termination.hbs.md)

#### <a id='1-7-0-tanzu-cli-insight-plugin'></a> v1.7.0 Features: Supply Chain Security Tools (SCST) - Store

- Artifact Metadata Repository (AMR) is deployed by default. For more information, see [Artifact Metadata Repository](scst-store/amr/overview.hbs.md).
- AMR [Authentication and authorization feature](scst-store/amr/auth.hbs.md) is introduced.
- AMR GraphQL now contains data for Images, Containers, and Location. For more information, see [Data Model and Concepts](scst-store/amr/data-model-and-concepts.hbs.md).

### <a id='1-7-0-resolved-issues'></a> v1.7.0 Resolved issues

The following issues, listed by component and area, are resolved in this release.

#### <a id='1-7-0-COMPONENT-NAME-ri'></a> v1.7.0 Resolved issues: COMPONENT-NAME

- Resolved issue description.

#### <a id='1-7-0-app-config-srvc-ri'></a> v1.7.0 Resolved issues: Application Configuration Service

- The pod security context now adheres to the restricted pod security standard, which prevents some
  installation failures.

#### <a id='1-7-0-app-sso-ri'></a> v1.7.0 Resolved issues: Application Single Sign-On

- Authorization servers advertise only supported scopes by using the discovery
  endpoint.
- `AuthServer.spec.identityProviders.*.name` has a description.
- `AuthServer.spec.identityProviders.*.name` is validated against DNS1123.
- `ClusterUnsafeTestLogin` reconciles only if the namespace designated by
  `cluster_resource_namespace` exists.
- Correctly implement the `restricted` Pod Security Standard for the
  controller and all `AuthServer`-related resources.
- Authorization servers display OIDC providers on the login page even when
  there are no SAML providers.

#### <a id='1-7-0-cnrs-ri'></a> v1.7.0 Resolved issues: Cloud Native Runtimes

- Certain app name, namespace, and domain combinations no longer product Knative Services with status `CertificateNotReady`.

#### <a id='1-7-0-supply-chain-choreographer-ri'></a> v1.7.0 Resolved issues: Supply Chain Choreographer

- You can safely ignore the label `apps.tanzu.vmware.com/carvel-package-workflow` when the Package Supply Chain is disabled. Previously, workloads with this label fail when the Package Supply Chain is disabled.
- Workloads failed on the image supply chains with `multiple supply chain matches` when testing or scanning supply chains are side loaded with the basic supply chain. Though side loading these supply chains is not a supported configuration, this fix allows you to continue to create workloads.
- The package Supply Chain can now generate a Carvel package when building an image from source and uploading it to a private registry using a certificate.

### <a id='1-7-0-known-issues'></a> v1.7.0 Known issues

This release has the following known issues, listed by component and area.

#### <a id='1-7-0-api-autoreg-ki'></a> v1.7.0 Known issues: API Auto Registration

Registering conflicting `groupId` and `version` with API portal:

- If you create two `CuratedAPIDescriptor`s with the same `groupId` and `version`
combination, both reconcile successfully without throwing an error,
and the `/openapi?groupId&version` endpoint returns both specs.
- If you are adding both specs to API portal, only one of them might show up in
the API portal UI with a warning indicating that there is a conflict.
- If you add the route provider annotation for both of the `CuratedAPIDescriptor`s to use SCG,
the generated API spec includes API routes from both `CuratedAPIDescriptor`s.
- You can see the `groupId` and `version` information from all `CuratedAPIDescriptor`s by running:

  ```console
  $ kubectl get curatedapidescriptors -A

  NAMESPACE           NAME         GROUPID            VERSION   STATUS   CURATED API SPEC URL
  my-apps             petstore     test-api-group     1.2.3     Ready    http://AAR-CONTROLLER-FQDN/openapi/my-apps/petstore
  default             mystery      test-api-group     1.2.3     Ready    http://AAR-CONTROLLER-FQDN/openapi/default/mystery
  ```

#### <a id='1-7-0-service-bindings-ki'></a> v1.7.0 Known issues: Service Bindings

When upgrading from a previous Tanzu Application Platform version, pods are recreated for all
workloads with service bindings.
This is because workloads and pods that use service bindings are being updated to new service
binding volumes. This happens automatically after upgrading to 1.7 and will not affect subsequent
upgrades.

Affected pods are updated concurrently. To avoid failures, you must have
sufficient Kubernetes resources in your clusters to support the pod rollout.

#### <a id='1-7-0-scc-ki'></a> v1.7.0 Known issues: Supply Chain Choreographer

- By default, Server Workload Carvel packages generated by the Carvel Package Supply Chains no longer contain OpenAPIv3 descriptions of their parameters. These descriptions were omitted to keep the size of the Carvel Package definition under 4 KB, which is the size limit for the string output of a Tekton Task. For information about these parameters, see [Carvel Package Supply Chains](scc/carvel-package-supply-chain.hbs.md).

#### <a id='1-7-0-scst-store-ki'></a> v1.7.0 Known issues: Supply Chain Security Tools - Store

- `Supply Chain Security Tools - Store` automatically detects PostgreSQL Database Index corruptions. Supply Chain Security Tools - Store does not reconcile if it finds a Postgres database index corruption issue. For information about remediating this issue, see [Fix Postgres Database Index Corruption](scst-store/database-index-corruption.hbs.md).

  `contour.default_tls_secret`. `default_tls_secret` will be removed in CNRs 2.7.0. In the meantime both options
  are going to be supported and `contour.default_tls_secret` will take precedence over `default_tls_secret`.

  are moved to `contour.[internal/external].namespace`. `ingress.[internal/external].namespace` will be removed in CNRs 2.7.0.
  In the meantime both options are going to be supported and `contour.[internal/external].namespace` will take precedence
  over `ingress.[internal/external].namespace`.

### <a id="scst-scan-deprecations"></a> Supply Chain Security Tools (SCST) - Scan deprecations

- The profile based installation of Grype to a developer namespace and related fields in the values file, such as `grype.namespace` and
  `grype.targetImagePullSecret`, were deprecated in Tanzu Application Platform v1.6.0 and are marked for removal in v1.8.0. Before removal, you can opt-in to use the profile based installation of Grype to a single namespace by setting `grype.namespace` in the `tap-values.yaml` configuration file.
- The `docker` field and related sub-fields used in SCST - Scan are deprecated and are removed in Tanzu Application Platform v1.7.0.

#### Linux Kernel CVEs

Kernel level vulnerabilities are regularly identified and patched by Canonical.
Tanzu Application Platform releases with available images, which might contain known vulnerabilities.
When Canonical makes patched images available, Tanzu Application Platform incorporates these fixed
images into future releases.

The kernel runs on your container host VM, not the Tanzu Application Platform container image.
Even with a patched Tanzu Application Platform image, the vulnerability is not mitigated until you
deploy your containers on a host with a patched OS. An unpatched host OS might be exploitable if
the base image is deployed.
